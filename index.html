<h1>Seth Wilson</h1>
<h2>Candidate for Alternate Delegate</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Seth Wilson. Thank you for visiting my page. I am a candidate for Alternate Delegate to the Republican National Convention representing the Sixth Congressional District. I enthusiastically ask you for your vote in our Republican Party Primary on May 14!</p>
<p>I was invited to be an Alternate Delegate affiliated with the Trump campaign and so, in accordance with Rule 16(f) of the Rules of the Republican Party, I have signed the Maryland Republican Party Congressional Delegate Pledge Form to nominate <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/">Donald J. Trump</a> as our Republican Party's candidate for President of the United States.</p>
<p>My roots in the Republican Party are deep, spanning over three decades. I am a lifelong Republican. I registered as member of the Republican Party when Ronald Reagan was President and have been a registered Republican ever since. I was a member of the Vanderbilt University College Republicans, founded a chapter of the Maryland Young Republicans in Washington County, and was elected Treasurer and then First Vice-President of the Washington County Republican Club.</p>
<p>Later, in 2013 I was appointed as a Member of the Washington County Republican Central Committee. I was elected to the Central Committee in 2014 and then re-elected in 2018 and 2022. I served as the Committee's First Vice Chair from 2014 to 2021 and its Chair in 2021 and 2022. During my time on the Central Committee, I have helped appoint multiple state legislators, county commissioners, and board members.</p>
<p>Politically, I believe in conservative principles of governance and the traditional values we share here in Western Maryland. I am a Republican because our Republican Party represents those principles and values better than any other political party. Creating a more effective and efficient government requires working with people. The people in the Republican Party are the best and I know I can work with them to achieve great things for everyone.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to find out more about me. If you would like to get in touch with me, please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:altdelegate@sethwilson.us">altdelegate@sethwilson.us</a>. Once again, I would appreciate your vote in our Republican Party Primary on May 14.</p>
